#Historical precedents and feasibility of rapid coal and gas decline required for

#Calculation of historical fossil fuel decline rates
#
#The code expects electricity generation data (csv) in the following format:
#Country (string) - country
#Year (integer) - year
#Fuel (string) - fuel, source of electricity generation* 
#Value (number) - electricity generation from the given source in the given year
#*Note: "Total" in the Fuel column means total electricity supply
#(electricity production plus net imports) necessary for normalizing decline rates
#For our paper we use World Energy Balances data available from IEA.
#With this code, we release a dataset with two fictitious countries for code testing purposes.

#Working directory should be set to the directory containing input files

#Necessary packages (should be installed)
